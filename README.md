# unruh_deWitt_on_massless_topological_black_holes

Numerical analyses of ["A ground state, a KMS state and the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector on massless hyperbolic black holes"](https://arxiv.org/) regarding an Unruh-deWitt detector on massless topological black holes with hyperbolic sections. 

There is only one Mathematica notebook with all the analyses and it has two package dependencies: one is for transforming ordinary differential equations [ODEsTransformations](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/ODEsTransformations) and the other is for generating plots with Latex style [LatexPlot](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/latex_style). The latter has its own dependencies as well ([MaTeX](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/9355/) and [CustomTicks](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/5599/)).
