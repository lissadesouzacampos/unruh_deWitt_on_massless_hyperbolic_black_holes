# unruh_deWitt_on_massless_hyperbolic_black_holes

Numerical analyses of ["Ground and thermal states for the Klein-Gordon field on a massless hyperbolic black hole with applications to the anti-Hawking effect"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03812) regarding an Unruh-deWitt detector on massless topological black holes with hyperbolic sections. 

There is only one Mathematica notebook with all the analyses and it has two package dependencies: one is for transforming ordinary differential equations [ODEsTransformations](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/ODEsTransformations) and the other is for generating plots with Latex style [LatexPlot](https://github.com/lissadesouzacampos/latex_style). The latter has its own dependencies as well ([MaTeX](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/9355/) and [CustomTicks](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/5599/)).
